# Notifications and alerts

Smart notifications keep you informed without overwhelming you. From dashboard tiles that persist until addressed to proactive battery alerts that prevent automation failures, these automations ensure you never miss important information.

## Why smart notifications?

**Persistent Visibility** - Dashboard tiles remind you until tasks are done

**Proactive Alerts** - Know about issues before they cause problems

**Whole Household** - Everyone sees the same information on dashboards

**Reduced Notification Fatigue** - Smart filtering shows only what matters

**Actionable Information** - Notifications that help you take action

**Family Coordination** - Reminders that work for everyone

## Notification types

### Dashboard tiles

**Best for:**
- Status that needs attention (washer done, door open)
- Tasks that need completing (garbage day)
- Persistent visibility for the household

**Advantages:**
- Everyone sees them
- Can't be dismissed accidentally
- Visual at-a-glance status

### Phone notifications

**Best for:**
- Urgent alerts (security, fire, water leak)
- Time-sensitive information
- Personal reminders

**Considerations:**
- Can be missed or dismissed
- Only reaches one person
- May cause notification fatigue

### Voice announcements

**Best for:**
- Immediate attention needed
- Hands-busy situations
- Whole-house awareness

**Considerations:**
- Can be disruptive
- May wake sleeping family
- Use quiet hours appropriately

### Combined approach

For important notifications, use multiple channels:

1. **Dashboard tile** - Persistent visibility
2. **Phone notification** - Immediate alert
3. **Voice announcement** - During appropriate hours

---

## Best practices

### Notification strategy

**Reduce fatigue:**
- Consolidate similar alerts
- Use escalating severity levels
- Set appropriate quiet hours
- Filter by mode (home/away/night)

**Make them actionable:**
- Include relevant information
- Provide one-tap actions when possible
- Clear what action is needed

### Dashboard design

**Keep it simple:**
- Most important items largest
- Group related items
- Consistent layout
- Use meaningful colors

**Color conventions:**
- Green: Good/off/complete
- Red: Attention needed/warning
- Yellow: Caution/transitional
- Blue: Informational

### Quiet hours

**Night mode notifications:**
- Visual only (no sounds)
- Emergency-only alerts audible
- Dashboard dims automatically
- Resume normal in morning
