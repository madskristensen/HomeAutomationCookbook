# Low battery alerts

Smart home devices with dead batteries can't do their jobs. Motion sensors stop detecting, door sensors go offline, and automations fail silently. Proactive battery monitoring ensures your smart home stays reliable.

## Use cases

<div class="use-case-grid">
  <div class="use-case-card">
    <h4>Prevention</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Security gaps</strong> - Door/window sensors going offline unnoticed</li>
      <li><strong>Failed automations</strong> - Motion sensors not triggering lights</li>
      <li><strong>Missed alerts</strong> - Water leak sensors not reporting</li>
      <li><strong>Lock failures</strong> - Smart lock battery dying at worst time</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="use-case-card">
    <h4>Maintenance</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proactive replacement</strong> - Replace before failure</li>
      <li><strong>Batch ordering</strong> - Know which batteries to stock</li>

## Monitoring approaches

### Individual device automations

Create one automation per device:

**Pros:**
- Simple to set up
- Custom thresholds per device
- Specific messaging

**Cons:**
- Many automations to manage
- Easy to miss new devices
- Harder to maintain

**Best for:** Small setups (< 10 devices)

### Group/template-based monitoring

One automation monitors all devices:

**Pros:**
- Single automation to maintain
- Automatically includes new devices
- Easier to manage

**Cons:**
- Same threshold for all devices
- More complex setup initially

**Best for:** Larger setups (10+ devices)

### Daily battery report

Scheduled check of all batteries:

- **Trigger:** Daily at 9:00 AM
- **Action:** Check all battery levels
- **Report:** List any devices below threshold
- **Benefit:** One notification instead of many

## Advanced features

### Tiered warnings

Different alerts at different levels:

**First warning (25%):**
- Normal notification
- "Consider replacing soon"
- Add to low battery list

**Second warning (15%):**
- Higher priority notification
- "Replace within next few days"

**Critical (5%):**
- Urgent notification
- "Replace immediately - device may stop working"

### Battery dashboard

Create visual overview:

**Dashboard elements:**
- All devices with battery percentage
- Color coding: green (50%+), yellow (20-50%), red (<20%)
- Sort by lowest first
- Show days since last change (if tracked)

### Device offline detection

Catch devices that died without warning:

- **Trigger:** Device hasn't reported in 24 hours
- **Action:** Send alert: "[Device] may be offline - check battery"
- **Note:** Some devices only report when triggered

### Battery change tracking

Log when batteries are replaced:

**Create input helper:**
- Date of last battery change per device
- Calculate expected replacement date
- Alert when approaching typical lifespan

**Typical battery life:**
- Contact sensors: 1-2 years
- Motion sensors: 6-18 months
- Smart locks: 6-12 months
- Temperature sensors: 1-2 years

### Critical device priority

Higher priority for important devices:

**Critical devices (immediate alert):**
- Smart locks
- Water leak sensors
- Smoke detector sensors

**Standard devices (daily report):**
- Motion sensors
- Temperature sensors
- Remote buttons

## Notification strategies

### Consolidated daily report

Instead of individual alerts:

**Daily at 9 AM:**
- Check all batteries
- Group into categories
- Send single notification:
  - "Critical: Front door lock (8%)"
  - "Low: Kitchen motion (18%), Garage door (22%)"
  - "OK: 15 devices above 30%"

### Weekly maintenance reminder

Scheduled battery check:

**Every Sunday at 10 AM:**
- List all devices below 30%
- Remind to check and replace
- Include battery types needed

### Notification cooldown

Prevent repeated alerts:

- Only notify once per device per week
- Unless level drops to next tier
- Reset cooldown when battery replaced

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Battery shows 100% then suddenly 0%

**Causes:**
- Device doesn't report gradual levels
- Reporting only "OK" or "Low"
- Battery type issue (some drop voltage rapidly)

**Solutions:**
✅ Check if device supports gradual reporting
✅ Watch for "low battery" state instead of percentage
✅ Use quality batteries (may report more accurately)
✅ Set replacement schedule based on time, not percentage

### Issue: Battery percentage fluctuates

**Causes:**
- Temperature affecting readings
- Voltage bounce after use
- Sensor inaccuracy
- Old battery recovering temporarily

**Solutions:**
✅ Use average over time instead of instant reading
✅ Only alert if low for extended period (hours)
✅ Consider actual battery age not just percentage
✅ Ignore small fluctuations (±5%)

### Issue: Missing devices in monitoring

**Causes:**
- Device doesn't report battery
- Entity not included in group
- Device using different attribute name

**Solutions:**
✅ Check device capabilities for battery reporting
✅ Manually add to monitoring group
✅ Check for alternative battery entity names
✅ Some devices need custom integration

### Issue: Too many notifications

**Causes:**
- Threshold too high (50% is too early)
- No cooldown between alerts
- Fluctuating readings triggering repeatedly

**Solutions:**
✅ Lower threshold to 20-25%
✅ Add cooldown (one notification per week)
✅ Use "dropped below" trigger not "is below"
✅ Consolidate into daily/weekly report

## Best practices

### Setting thresholds

**Recommended levels:**
- **Warning:** 20-25% (weeks of life remaining)
- **Low:** 10-15% (days of life remaining)
- **Critical:** 5% (replace immediately)

**Adjust for device type:**
- Smart locks: Higher threshold (25%) - don't want lockout
- Motion sensors: Standard threshold (20%)
- Temperature sensors: Lower threshold (15%) - less critical

### Battery inventory

**Keep on hand:**
- List of all battery types used
- 2-3 spares of common types
- Note which devices use which battery
- Order before running out

### Replacement strategy

**Best practices:**
- Replace at warning level, not when dead
- Replace all batteries in multi-battery devices together
- Note replacement date for tracking
- Use quality batteries for critical devices
- Consider rechargeable for frequently changed devices

### Device placement for longevity

**Extend battery life:**
- Avoid extreme temperatures
- Reduce unnecessary triggers (adjust sensitivity)
- Keep devices in good signal range (less retry = less battery)
- Consider wired alternatives for high-use locations
