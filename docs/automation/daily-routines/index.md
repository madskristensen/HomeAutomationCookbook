# Daily routines

Daily routine automations make your smart home adapt to the rhythm of your life. From gentle morning wake-ups to secure away modes, these automations handle the repetitive tasks so you don't have to think about them.

<div class="category-intro" markdown="1">

## Why automate daily routines?

**Consistent Experience** - Same great start to every morning

**Energy Savings** - Automatic away mode reduces heating/cooling costs by 10-15%

**Enhanced Security** - Home arms itself when everyone leaves

**Seamless Transitions** - Arrive home to perfect lighting and temperature

**Reduced Mental Load** - No more "did I remember to..." anxiety

**Family Coordination** - Routines work for everyone, not just the tech-savvy

## Understanding home modes

Most smart home platforms support modes that define the overall state of your home:

### Home mode
**When:** Someone is home and awake
**Actions:**
- Normal lighting automation
- Comfortable temperature
- Motion sensors active
- Entertainment available

### Away mode
**When:** No one is home
**Actions:**
- Lights off (or security pattern)
- Eco temperature settings
- Security system armed
- Cameras active

### Night mode
**When:** Sleeping hours
**Actions:**
- Low-brightness lighting only
- Lower temperature
- Minimal notifications
- Motion sensors dimmed

### Custom modes
Many platforms allow custom modes:
- **Guest Mode** - Modified automation for visitors
- **Vacation Mode** - Extended away with enhanced security
- **Party Mode** - Special lighting and music
- **Work from Home** - Office-optimized settings

## Presence detection methods

### GPS/Location services

**How it works:** Phone reports location to platform

**Pros:**
- Works everywhere
- No additional hardware
- Integrates with most platforms

**Cons:**
- Battery drain
- GPS can drift near home boundary
- Requires app background access

**Best for:** Primary home/away detection

### WiFi presence

**How it works:** Detect phone connected to home WiFi

**Pros:**
- No battery drain
- Very accurate when home
- Privacy-friendly

**Cons:**
- Only works at home
- Doesn't detect approaching

**Best for:** Verification method, backup to GPS

### Combined approach (recommended)

Use multiple methods for accuracy:

1. **GPS** - Primary detection (home/away)
2. **Motion sensors** - Verify no one home before away mode
3. **WiFi** - Confirm presence at home
4. **Door sensors** - Physical entry/exit verification

---

## Best practices

### Start conservative

**Initial setup:**
- Longer delays (15 minutes before away mode)
- Multiple verification methods
- Manual override always available
- Conservative geofence radius (100+ meters)

**Then refine:**
- Gradually reduce delays
- Remove unnecessary verifications
- Expand automation actions

### Notification strategy

**Always notify for:**
- Away mode activation
- Door auto-unlock
- Security state changes

**Optional notifications:**
- Someone arrived home
- Mode changes

### Fail-safe design

**When uncertain:**
- Don't activate away mode
- Don't unlock doors
- Don't change security state
- Better safe than automated

**Manual override:**
- Physical controls always work
- App manual mode toggle
- Voice command override

---

## Common challenges

### False away mode activation

**Solutions:**
- Add motion sensor verification
- Increase geofence radius
- Add 10-15 minute delay
- Check for TV/device activity

### Delayed presence detection

**Solutions:**
- Disable battery optimization for app
- Enable "Always" location permission
- Use local processing
- Add WiFi presence backup

### Kids without phones

**Solutions:**
- Time-based overrides (school hours)
- Extended motion detection periods
- Manual "Kids Home" toggle
- Door sensor verification
