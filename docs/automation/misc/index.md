## Common patterns

### Power monitoring detection

Many misc automations use power monitoring to detect device usage:

**Setup:**
1. Plug device into power monitoring smart plug
2. Observe normal power consumption
3. Create automation when power rises/falls
4. Use as trigger or condition

**Examples:**
- White noise machine: Baby sleeping when > 5W
- Electric toothbrush charger: Used when > 2W
- Doorbell transformer: Ring when power spikes

### Time-based schedules

Many misc automations are time-driven:

**Patterns:**
- Sunset/sunrise triggers
- Specific time triggers
- Day of week conditions
- Time range conditions

**Examples:**
- Outdoor lights at sunset
- Teeth reminder 8-10 PM window

### Virtual switches for state

Track state across automations:

**Pattern:**
- Create virtual switch or input boolean
- Toggle on/off based on events
- Use as condition in other automations

**Examples:**
- "Baby Sleeping" switch
- "Dishwasher Clean" switch
