# Security and safety automations

A lot of people start their smart home because they want added security. That's typically done by adding camera systems both indoors and outdoors around the house. However, there are plenty of other automations we can add to help secure the house or make us feel safer.

<div class="category-intro" markdown="1">

## Why security automation?

**Deterrence** — Make your home look occupied when you're away

**Emergency Response** — Automated actions during fire or break-in

**Peace of Mind** — Know your home is secure without constant checking

**Family Safety** — Protect loved ones with automated safety measures

**Cost Effective** — Many security automations use existing smart devices

**Always Active** — Security automations work 24/7 without human intervention

## Quick start guide

### 1. Assess your security needs

**Common Concerns:**
- Package theft from porch
- Break-ins while away
- Fire and smoke emergencies
- Window break detection
- Perimeter monitoring

**Prioritize:**
1. Start with away lighting (easy, effective)
2. Add emergency response automation
3. Consider advanced deterrents

### 2. Inventory existing devices

**Already Have:**
- Smart light switches or bulbs
- Smart door locks
- Motion sensors
- Smoke detectors
- Smart plugs

**May Need:**
- Smart smoke detector or listener
- Glass break sensor
- Smart irrigation controller
- Outdoor motion sensors

### 3. Plan your automations

**Away Security:**
- Which lights to use for away pattern
- What times to simulate activity
- Integration with home modes

**Emergency Response:**
- Smoke detector integration method
- Which lights come on
- Which doors unlock
- Notification targets

## Detection methods

### Smart smoke detectors

**Native Smart Detectors:**
- Nest Protect (smoke + CO)
- First Alert Onelink
- Ring Alarm Smoke Listener

**Pros:**
- Direct integration
- Self-testing
- Phone notifications
- Detailed alerts

**Cons:**
- More expensive
- May require ecosystem buy-in

### Sound-based detection

**How it works:** Device listens for smoke alarm sound pattern

**Options:**
- Amazon Echo Guard feature (built into Alexa devices)
- Dedicated smoke alarm listeners
- Multi-purpose audio sensors

**Pros:**
- Works with existing smoke detectors
- No rewiring needed
- Affordable

**Cons:**
- Can miss quieter alarms
- May false trigger on similar sounds

### Wired relay method

**How it works:** Relay attached to smoke detector wiring acts like open/closed sensor

**Pros:**
- Very reliable
- Works with interconnected detectors
- Detects any hardwired alarm

**Cons:**
- Requires electrical work
- More complex installation
- Not for DIY unless comfortable with wiring

### Glass break sensors

**How they work:** Detect specific sound frequency of breaking glass

**Options:**
- Standalone glass break sensors
- Multi-sensors with glass break
- Ring Glass Break Sensor
- Aqara Vibration Sensor (alternative approach)

**Best placement:**
- Central location in room
- Within 25 feet of windows
- Away from noisy appliances

## Security modes integration

### Away mode security

When home enters Away mode:
- Activate away lighting pattern
- Arm perimeter sensors
- Enable camera recording
- Lock all doors
- Start random light patterns

### Night mode security

When home enters Night mode:
- Arm perimeter sensors
- Enable exterior cameras
- Low-level night lighting
- Motion sensors in entry points only

### Vacation mode

Extended absence settings:
- Enhanced away lighting patterns
- Package delivery alerts
- Daily notification summaries
- Neighbor alert integration

## Common challenges & solutions

### Challenge: False alarms

**Causes:**
- Cooking smoke triggers detector
- Sound detection picks up TV audio
- Motion sensors triggered by pets

**Solutions:**
✅ Use time delays before major actions
✅ Require multiple triggers (smoke + motion)
✅ Exclude kitchen from immediate response
✅ Use pet-immune motion sensors

### Challenge: Notification fatigue

**Causes:**
- Too many security alerts
- Alerts for normal activity
- Redundant notifications

**Solutions:**
✅ Consolidate alerts into summaries
✅ Use escalating notification levels
✅ Smart filtering based on mode
✅ Critical-only during certain hours

### Challenge: Battery-powered sensors

**Causes:**
- Sensors go offline with dead batteries
- No notification of low battery
- Security gaps when sensors offline

**Solutions:**
✅ Regular battery check automations
✅ Low battery notifications
✅ Use devices with long battery life
✅ Consider wired alternatives for critical sensors

## Best practices

### Layered security

**Perimeter Layer:**
- Exterior motion sensors
- Driveway detection
- Fence line monitoring

**Entry Layer:**
- Door/window sensors
- Glass break detection
- Smart locks

**Interior Layer:**
- Motion sensors
- Cameras
- Smoke/CO detection

### Testing your automations

**Regular Testing:**
1. Test smoke detector monthly
2. Verify automation triggers work
3. Check all notifications arrive
4. Ensure doors unlock properly
5. Test during different modes

**Document:**
- Write down expected behavior
- Note any issues found
- Update automations as needed

### Family communication

**Everyone Should Know:**
- How to trigger manual alarm
- How to disable false alarm
- What happens in emergency
- Where to go if fire occurs

**Practice:**
- Run fire drill with automation
- Test manual overrides
- Verify everyone gets notifications

## Additional security ideas

### Motion-activated cameras

Record only when motion detected:
- Save storage space
- Easier to review footage
- Get notified of activity

### Smart doorbell integration

Combine with security automation:
- Package delivery detection
- Visitor recording
- Two-way communication
- Integration with locks

### Geofencing for security

Location-based security:
- Auto-arm when all leave
- Auto-disarm when arriving
- Notification if someone arrives unexpectedly
- Different behavior for family vs. strangers
