# Lighting automations

Lighting is the foundation of home automation. Automatic lights create a seamless, hands-free experience that makes your home feel alive and responsive. Whether triggered by motion, door sensors, or the time of day, these automations solve everyday problems and enhance your quality of life.

## Why lighting automation?

**Hands-Free Convenience** - Lights turn on automatically when you need them

**Energy Savings** - Lights turn off when rooms are unoccupied

**Safety at Night** - Never stumble in the dark again

**Curb Appeal** - Outdoor lights on at dusk for a welcoming home

**True Automation** - Works without any input from you

**Versatile Triggers** - Motion, door sensors, sunset, or schedules

## Quick start guide

### 1. Choose your trigger type

**Motion Sensors:**
- Best for rooms you pass through
- Immediate response
- Works for any occupant

**Door Sensors:**
- Best for closets and cabinets
- Very reliable
- Long battery life

**Time/Sunset:**
- Best for outdoor lighting
- Predictable schedule
- No sensors needed

### 2. Select your lights

**Smart Switches (Recommended):**
- Works with existing fixtures
- Physical switch still works
- No bulb replacement needed

**Smart Bulbs:**
- Color and temperature control
- Dimming without wiring
- More flexible

### 3. Start simple

**First Automation:**
1. Pick one high-traffic room
2. Create basic trigger → light on
3. Test for a few days
4. Add conditions and refinements
5. Expand to more rooms

## Trigger methods

### Motion sensors

**How it works:** Detects movement using infrared or radar

**Best for:**
- Bathrooms, hallways, closets
- Entryways, outdoor areas
- Any room you pass through

**Considerations:**
- Placement is critical
- May miss stationary people
- Combine with door sensors for best results

### Door sensors

**How it works:** Magnetic contact detects open/close

**Best for:**
- Closets and pantries
- Cabinet lighting
- Garage entry points

**Considerations:**
- Very reliable
- Long battery life
- Instant response

### Sunset/Sunrise

**How it works:** Triggers based on sun position

**Best for:**
- Outdoor lighting
- Holiday lights
- Landscape lighting

**Considerations:**
- No sensors needed
- Consistent schedule
- Can use lux sensor for cloudy days

## Common use cases

### 💡 Motion-based lighting
- Bathroom lights on when entering
- Hallway lights during nighttime
- Garage lights when arriving home
- Outdoor motion floodlights

### 🚪 Door-triggered lighting
- Closet lights when door opens
- Pantry illumination
- Cabinet under-lighting
- Garage entry lights

### 🌅 Time-based lighting
- Porch lights at sunset
- Pathway lights for safety
- Holiday light scheduling
- Landscape accent lighting

### 🌙 Night mode lighting
- Low brightness for nighttime trips
- Warm color temperature
- Minimal sleep disruption
- Safe navigation

## Best practices

### Sensor placement

**Motion Sensors:**
- 6-8 feet high for best coverage
- Point toward entry paths
- Avoid windows and heat sources
- Test before permanent mounting

**Door Sensors:**
- Sensor on frame, magnet on door
- Within 20mm gap when closed
- Clean surfaces before mounting
- Test alignment before permanent install

### Timing considerations

**Motion timeout by room type:**
- Quick access (closets): 1-2 minutes
- Living spaces: 3-5 minutes
- Work areas: 5-10 minutes
- Bathrooms: Use door sensor override

### Day vs. night

**Daytime:** 100% brightness or skip if natural light
**Evening:** 50-75% brightness
**Nighttime:** 10-20% brightness, warm color

## Troubleshooting

**Lights turn on too slowly?**
- Check sensor placement (detect before entering)
- Use local processing instead of cloud
- Simplify automation conditions
- Add Zigbee/Z-Wave repeaters

**Lights turn off while room is occupied?**
- Add door sensor override
- Increase timeout duration
- Add additional motion sensors
- Use occupancy sensors for stationary detection

**False triggers?**
- Adjust motion sensor sensitivity
- Add lux sensor condition
- Position away from windows and heat sources
- Use pet-immune sensors
