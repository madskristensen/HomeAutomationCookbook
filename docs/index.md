## Why this site exists

**Most smart homes are not smart at all.** They are collections of gadgets demanding attention, confusing overnight guests, and quietly frustrating the people who live there.

This cookbook offers something different. Every automation here has been shaped by a simple truth: technology should recede into the background, noticed only in its absence. The recipes that follow are built on tested principles:

<div class="principles-grid">
  <div class="principle-card">
    <h3>Works for everyone</h3>
    <p>Children, grandparents, weekend guests - no one should need a tutorial. Physical switches still work. Automations feel inevitable rather than clever.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="principle-card">
    <h3>Actually saves time</h3>
    <p>Each automation removes a small worry from your day. No more wondering if the door is locked or if the laundry has been sitting too long.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="principle-card">
    <h3>Platform agnostic</h3>
    <p>Works with all major platforms:</p>
